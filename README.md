2) Bugs
If you find that the recharging time is not accurate please email it, and I will add some changes.

I have tested out the recharing time on DJI Phantom 3 Pro and 2 drone batteries and the calculating recharing time
for this drone is the most accurate. The rest recharging times are my calculation
